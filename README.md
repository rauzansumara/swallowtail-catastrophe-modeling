A dynamical system can be defined as a set of interacting variables with properties of continuity, determination, and infinite duration. The mechanisms of a dynamical system include: bifurcations, transformation of a system from one type to another. Bifurcation theory, as proposed by [1], was further developed through the application of the work of mathematician Rene Thom. [2] provided the complete proof for the existence of seven elementary catastrophes, which he termed, in order of complexity, the fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, elliptic umbilic, hyperbolic umbilic, and parabolic umbilic. Catastrophe theory is derived from topology, a field of mathematics that studies the properties of surfaces in numerous dimensions. According to Thom’s theory, catastrophe models are the key points to analyze the catastrophe characteristics of system. However, how to transform the mathematical models into catastrophe models of a system is a worth studying problem. For this purpose，this report discus the transformation methods to change the mathematical models into swallowtail catastrophe models of a nonlinear system.
